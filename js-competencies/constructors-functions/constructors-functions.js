//////////////////PROBLEM 3////////////////////

// Write a constructor function Caveman that takes in a name, age, and weapon as its three parameters.

// Now create a new Caveman with the constructor function you made called 'larry'. 
// Larry is 25 and has a 'rock' for a weapon.
// Save the result to a variable called larry.

//Code here

let larry = new Caveman('Larry', 25, 'rock');
